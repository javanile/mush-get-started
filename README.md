# Mush Get Started

Welcome to the **Mush Get Started** hackathon! 🚀

## 🌟 Mission
Your mission is to create a command-line program that is useful in the Docker or DevOps world. You **must use Mush** and write code following the **Mush standard**. You can develop any tool that simplifies daily operations, such as:
